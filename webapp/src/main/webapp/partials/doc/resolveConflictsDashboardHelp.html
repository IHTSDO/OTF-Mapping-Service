  <h4>Resolve Conflicts Record Dashboard Help</h4>

  <p>This page is for a lead to review and resolve a map record conflict. It provides
    facilities for choosing a starting point, reviewing reasons for differences,
    initiating feedback conversations.  The standard map record editing interface
    used by specialists is also reused here to allow the lead to create the final, correct,
    state of the map and save or finish work.</p>
